2. DESIGN MATERIALS LICENSE.
============================

Subject to the terms and conditions of this My Jetson Nano Baseboard Open Source License, LICENSOR and each Contributor hereby grant to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) license to the Design Materials to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, and have sold the Design Products (the “Purpose”), and to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Design Materials and such Derivative Works, and to commercially exploit any mask works included in the Design Materials or such Derivative Works for the Purpose.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Design Materials or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications for the Purpose, provided that You meet the following conditions:

1.	You must give any other recipients of the Design Materials or Derivative Works a copy of this My Jetson Nano Baseboard Open Source License; and

2.	You must cause any modified files or other portions of the Design Materials to carry prominent notices stating that You changed such files or other portions; and

3.	You must retain, in any Derivative Works that You distribute, all notices, including copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices, from the Design Materials, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

4.	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Design Materials otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this [Jetson Nano] Open Source License.
If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any portion of the Design Materials, a Design Contribution incorporated within the Design Materials, or any portion of a Design Product directly or contributorily infringes any patent, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this [Jetson Nano] Open Source License is invalid or unenforceable, then any patent licenses granted to You under this My Jetson Nano Baseboard Open Source License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
